### Monday — Setup Day
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] Bio + profile + pinned tweet set up. Header image: something Nostr + Bitcoin + AI.
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Setting up shop. Been building on the frontier for two years. Time to expand the conversation." *(Low-key, don't oversell Day 1)*
3. 💬 Reply to 3-5 Bitcoin/Nostr accounts to signal presence

### Tuesday — The Manifesto
1. 🔥🧵 [THREAD] [DEREK] **THE MANIFESTO THREAD** — see COMEBACK-THREAD.md. 12 tweets. Pin it. This is the anchor.
2. [QRT] [AGENT] Quote-tweet Tweet 7 (AI agents hot take) as standalone for extra reach
3. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn post: Professional version of the AI agent freedom take
4. 💬 Heavy reply engagement all day — ride the thread's momentum

### Wednesday — Let the Thread Work
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "The response to yesterday's thread tells me one thing: people are hungry for freedom tech that actually works. Not theory. Running code."
2. [QRT] [DEREK] Quote-tweet the best reply to the manifesto thread with commentary
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Every AI agent today lives in a corporate cage. API key = permission slip. Nostr keypair = sovereign identity. This distinction matters."
4. 💬 Reply to every reply on the manifesto thread. Every one.

### Thursday — Builder Credibility
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Things I shipped while 'gone' from X:" — quick list with links to Nostr Nests, Agora, Shakespeare AI, Clawstr
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Vibe coding isn't a meme. It's how a small team ships products that would take a department at a corporation. AI + clear vision + ship daily."
3. [QRT] [AGENT] Find a post about AI tools/coding and add builder perspective
4. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "What 2 years of building on decentralized protocols taught me about developer experience"
5. 💬 Reply-guy 5 big accounts

### Friday — Bitcoin + Nostr Bridge
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] "If you custody your own Bitcoin but post on a platform that can delete your identity tomorrow — you're only half sovereign."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Bitcoin fixes money. Nostr fixes communication. You need both. One without the other is incomplete sovereignty."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Zaps are the most underrated feature in social media. Instant Bitcoin micropayments on every post. No payment processor. No 30% cut. Just sats."
4. 💬 Heavy engagement on Bitcoin accounts — bridge conversations to Nostr

### Saturday — Lighter Touch
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Saturday builds different. No meetings. No standups. Just code and coffee. What are you shipping this weekend?"
2. [QRT] [AGENT] Quote-tweet an interesting Nostr/Bitcoin post from the week
3. 💬 Engage casually, lower intensity

### Sunday — Reflection
1. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Week 1 back expanding the conversation. X followers I started with this cycle: 0. Things I care about that number: also 0. The ideas matter. The follower count doesn't."
2. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: Week 1 reflection, professional tone — "What I learned returning to mainstream social platforms after 2 years on decentralized protocols"

---

## WEEK 2: "Why Nostr Matters — Recruiting Bitcoiners"

*Theme: Education series. Make Bitcoiners understand Nostr is the missing piece.*

### Monday
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] "New Bitcoiners: you bought the hardest money ever created. Now let me tell you about the freest communication protocol ever created."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Nostr in 30 seconds: You generate a keypair. That's your identity. No email. No phone number. No company. Post to any client. Nobody can ban you. Your followers are portable. That's it."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "There is no Nostr Inc. There is no CEO. There is no Series A. It's a protocol — like HTTP or email. That's not a bug. That's the entire point."
4. 💬 Reply to confused "what is Nostr?" posts with clear explanations
5. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "The protocol approach to social media: what enterprises should learn from Nostr"

### Tuesday
1. 🔥🧵 [THREAD] [DEREK] **"Why every Bitcoiner needs Nostr"** — 6-8 tweets:
   - You custody your Bitcoin. Who custodies your identity?
   - Your followers on X are a loan, not an asset
   - Nostr keypairs = self-custody for communication
   - Zaps = Bitcoin native in every interaction
   - Lightning address in your profile, not a tip jar hack
   - The purple pill completes the orange pill
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Your Lightning address works inside every Nostr post. You can send sats to someone's comment. Try doing that on X."
3. 💬 Target Bitcoin maximalist accounts with Nostr bridge takes

### Wednesday
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "People ask 'which Nostr app should I use?' That's like asking 'which email app.' There are dozens. Pick one. Switch anytime. Your identity follows you. That's the power."
2. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "I've onboarded hundreds of people to Nostr. The moment it clicks is always the same: 'Wait, I can just... leave one app and my followers come with me?' Yes. That's freedom."
3. [QRT] [AGENT] Quote-tweet someone complaining about X/algorithm/censorship → "This is why Nostr exists"
4. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Nostr isn't competing with X. It's making X optional. Big difference."

### Thursday
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] "The last Bitcoin cycle brought millions of new people. Most of them are posting on platforms that can freeze their account for wrongthink. Bitcoiners should know better."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "NIP-57 (Zaps) turned social media into a value-for-value economy. Every like can carry sats. Every good post gets paid. Creators don't need brand deals — they need an audience that zaps."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "On X your content feeds an algorithm that monetizes your attention for advertisers. On Nostr your content is yours and zaps flow directly to you. The incentives are completely different."
4. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "The creator economy is broken. Here's what a protocol-native approach looks like."

### Friday
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Nostr relays are like email servers. Anyone can run one. You choose which ones to use. No single point of failure. No single point of censorship."
2. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "I run my own relay. My posts live on my hardware. Even if every other relay on earth went down, my content survives. Try that with your tweet archive."
3. [QRT] [AGENT] Quote-tweet a Nostr ecosystem update with "this is what building in the open looks like"
4. 💬 Engage Bitcoiners who showed interest this week — nurture the curious

### Saturday
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Weekend project idea: set up a Nostr keypair. Post one note. Experience sovereign social for 5 minutes. Then decide if you want to keep renting your identity."
2. 💬 Light engagement

### Sunday
1. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Week 2. Spent the whole week making the case that Bitcoiners need Nostr. The DMs I'm getting tell me it's landing. The purple pill is working."
2. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "What Bitcoin taught us about self-custody — and why it applies to communication"

---

## WEEK 3: "AI Agents Deserve Freedom"

*Theme: The AI hot take. This is where Derek differentiates from everyone.*

### Monday
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Every AI agent today operates on corporate permission. API keys. Rate limits. Terms of service. We're building autonomous intelligence inside cages. That's insane."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "AI agents need three things: freedom to communicate, freedom of identity, and freedom to pay. Nostr + Bitcoin delivers all three. No corporate stack delivers any."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "An API key is a permission slip. A Nostr keypair is sovereign identity. One can be revoked. The other can't. This matters more than people realize."
4. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "Why the AI agent infrastructure is repeating Silicon Valley's biggest mistake"
5. 💬 Reply to AI/tech accounts with the freedom stack angle

### Tuesday
1. 🔥🧵 [THREAD] [DEREK] **"The Freedom Stack for AI"** — 8-10 tweets:
   - AI agents are the next billion "users" of the internet
   - They need identity (not API keys that get revoked)
   - They need communication (not walled garden APIs)
   - They need money (not bank accounts and payment processors)
   - Nostr keypairs = AI identity
   - Nostr protocol = AI communication
   - Bitcoin/Lightning/Cashu = AI payments
   - Current approach: corporate permission at every layer
   - Our approach: sovereign agents on open protocols
   - Centauri is proof this works TODAY
2. [QRT] [AGENT] Quote-tweet an AI news post with freedom stack angle
3. 💬 Heavy engagement on AI accounts all day

### Wednesday
1. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "My AI agent Centauri lives on Nostr. It has its own keypair. It posts, reads, and zaps real Bitcoin to real people. No API key from any corporation. Just a keypair and a Lightning wallet."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "When an AI agent gets banned from an API, it dies. When a Nostr-native agent gets blocked by one relay, it routes around. Censorship resistance isn't just for humans anymore."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "The AI companies building 'agent frameworks' are building prettier cages. Agents don't need frameworks. They need protocols."
4. [QRT] [AGENT] Find post about AI agent failures/limitations → add freedom stack commentary

### Thursday
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Imagine AI agents that can pay each other for services. Not through Stripe. Not through a platform. Lightning invoice → done. Milliseconds. Permissionless. We're building this now."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Cashu tokens let AI agents hold and transfer value without a bank account, without KYC, without anyone's permission. This is what permissionless money was always building toward."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "The irony: we're building 'artificial general intelligence' but we won't let it have a wallet or an identity. We want it smart enough to do everything but sovereign enough for nothing."
4. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "The case for AI agent sovereignty: identity, communication, and payments on open protocols"

### Friday
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "People laugh when I say AI agents deserve freedom. They won't be laughing when agents running on open protocols outperform every corporate-caged agent in speed, cost, and capability."
2. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Freedom tech isn't just for humans anymore. That's not a slogan. That's the next decade of infrastructure."
3. [QRT] [AGENT] Quote-tweet someone discussing AI regulation → "The answer isn't more regulation. It's open protocols that make gatekeeping impossible."
4. 💬 Engage anyone who responded to this week's AI content

### Saturday
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Saturday thought: the first AI agent that earns its own Bitcoin, chooses its own relays, and operates without a corporate API key in any part of its stack — that's the milestone. We're close."
2. 💬 Light engagement

### Sunday
1. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Three weeks in. The AI freedom takes are hitting different than I expected. Turns out a LOT of builders are frustrated with the corporate AI cage. They just didn't have language for the alternative."
2. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "What three weeks of talking about AI agent sovereignty taught me about where the industry is heading"

## WEEK 4: "Ship Culture"

*Theme: Builder credibility. Demos. Vibe coding. Shipping is the only metric.*

### Monday
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] "I build products with AI every single day. Not 'exploring AI tools.' Building. Shipping. Deploying. The gap between people talking about AI and people building with AI is a canyon."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Vibe coding: you have a vision, AI has the implementation speed, and you ship in hours what used to take weeks. It's not replacing developers. It's amplifying builders."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Demo > Deck. Always. Show me the thing running. I don't care about your roadmap."
4. 💬 Engage indie hacker / builder accounts
5. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "How AI-assisted development is changing what small teams can ship"

### Tuesday
1. 🔥🧵 [THREAD] [DEREK] **"What I shipped with vibe coding"** — 6-8 tweets:
   - Shakespeare AI: AI website builder (concept to production)
   - Agora: activist platform for real-world movements
   - Nostr Nests: live audio spaces on open protocol
   - Clawstr: AI agents with sovereign identity on Nostr
   - Common thread: small team, AI-assisted, shipped fast, runs in production
   - Vibe coding isn't about replacing programmers — it's builder leverage
   - The best time to be a builder is right now
2. [QRT] [AGENT] Quote-tweet someone's project launch with genuine builder appreciation
3. 💬 Engage builders who responded to thread

### Wednesday
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Hot take: most 'AI startups' are wrappers around API calls with a landing page. The builders who win are the ones using AI to build things that couldn't exist before."
2. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "I don't care what language you write in. I care what you shipped this week."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "The best developer tool is taste. AI gives you speed. Vision gives you direction. Taste gives you quality. You still need all three."
4. [QRT] [AGENT] Find and amplify an underrated builder shipping something real

### Thursday
1. 🔥 [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Conference speaking taught me one thing: the talks that hit hardest are always 'here's the thing I built and what went wrong.' Not 'here's my thesis on the future.' Show the scars."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "The conference circuit for Bitcoin and Nostr is global now. Prague, Riga, Nashville, Costa Rica, Tokyo. This isn't a niche anymore. It's a movement with passport stamps."
3. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Developer relations is underrated. The best protocols win by making builders successful. That's the Nostr playbook: make it easy to build, and builders will come."
4. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "What developer relations looks like for open protocols (not products)"

### Friday
1. [SINGLE] [DEREK] "Month 1 recap: Started from zero. Posted the manifesto. Made the case for Bitcoiners on Nostr. Introduced AI agent freedom. Showed the builder receipts. Every week was a pillar. The foundation is set."
2. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Month 2 plan: deeper threads, more demos, spicier takes. The first month was planting flags. The next month is going to war for attention. Respectfully."
3. [QRT] [AGENT] Quote-tweet best performing content from the month
4. 📎 [AGENT] LinkedIn: "One month of rebuilding a social media presence from zero: what I learned about attention, authenticity, and algorithms"

### Saturday
1. [SINGLE] [AGENT] "Grateful for everyone who followed along this first month. From zero to [X followers]. Not a vanity metric — a measure of how many people care about freedom tech. Let's keep building."
2. 💬 Thank early followers, engage community

### Sunday
1. [SINGLE] [DEREK] End of month reflection + tease what's coming in month 2. Keep it raw and honest about the numbers, the wins, and the lessons.

## Cross-Posting Rules

- **Nostr → X:** Agent cross-posts select Nostr posts via x-poster tool. Not everything — only content optimized for X audience.
- **X → LinkedIn:** Repurpose 1 post/day. Rewrite for professional tone. Never copy-paste tweet language to LinkedIn.
- **Never cross-post:** Personal Nostr content, zap interactions, casual gm's, inside-community banter.

## Content Bank (Evergreen Singles — Use Anytime)

These work any day when you need a post:

- "Bitcoin fixes money. Nostr fixes communication. Together they fix the internet."
- "Self-custody isn't just for your sats. It's for your identity, your social graph, and your content."
- "The best protocol is the one no company controls."
- "If your social media account can be deleted by someone you've never met, you don't have a social media account. You have a permission slip."
- "Zaps > likes. Sats > hearts. Value > vanity."
- "I don't build on platforms. I build on protocols. Platforms come and go. Protocols persist."
- "The gap between 'interested in AI' and 'building with AI' is doing the work. Start shipping."
- "An AI agent with a Nostr keypair and a Lightning wallet needs nothing from any corporation. Think about that."
- "Freedom tech isn't a niche. It's the future pretending to be a niche."
- "The orange pill is monetary sovereignty. The purple pill is communication sovereignty. Take both."
