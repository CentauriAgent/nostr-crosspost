# Social Media Growth Strategy — Derek Ross (@derekross)

*Rebuilding from zero. No shortcuts. Just signal.*

---

## Mission

Become the bridge between Nostr/freedom tech and the mainstream tech audience on X. Rebuild authority, grow followers organically, and drive adoption of Nostr, Bitcoin, and open protocols.

---

## Content Pillars

### 1. Recruiting Bitcoiners to Nostr (30%)
- This Bitcoin cycle brought millions of new people — they need to know about Nostr
- Bitcoin fixes money, Nostr fixes communication. They go together.
- "The purple pill helps the orange pill go down"
- You custody your Bitcoin but rent your identity? Finish the job.
- Sound money takes that bridge to protocol sovereignty
- Lightning + Nostr (zaps, V4V, micropayments) — show the integration

### 2. AI Agents Deserve Freedom (30%)
- **THE hot take:** AI agents should NOT need API keys and corporate gatekeepers
- Freedom of communication (Nostr), freedom of identity (keypairs), freedom to pay (Bitcoin/Lightning/Cashu)
- Current AI infrastructure = rebuilding walled gardens for machines
- Nostr + Bitcoin = the freedom stack for AI
- Clawstr demos, Centauri as proof of concept
- Building AI agents in public — real demos, real transactions

### 3. Nostr Evangelism & Builder Culture (25%)
- Nostr is thriving — millions of events, dozens of clients, global community
- Protocol updates, client demos, ecosystem growth
- Expanding the conversation, not leaving and coming back
- Freedom tech needs evangelists EVERYWHERE
- Shipping in public — Shakespeare AI, Agora, Nostr Nests, Clawstr

### 4. Vibe Coding & The Builder Ethos (15%)
- AI-assisted development philosophy
- Ship > talk. Demos > decks. Code > committees.
- Hot takes on tech culture and startup theatre
- Conference stories and hallway insights

## Daily Posting Cadence

### X/Twitter: 3-5 native posts per day

| Time (EST) | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 7:00-8:00 AM | Morning take | Hot take, opinion, or observation. Start conversations. |
| 11:00 AM-12:00 PM | Educational / thread | Deeper content. Threads, demos, explainers. |
| 2:00-3:00 PM | Engagement / QRT | Quote-tweet someone notable with a strong take. |
| 5:00-6:00 PM | Builder update | What you shipped, what you're working on, demo clips. |
| 8:00-9:00 PM | (Optional) Evening provocation | Controversial but substantive. Drives overnight engagement. |

### LinkedIn: 1 post per day

| Time | Type |
|---|---|
| 8:00-9:00 AM EST | Thought leadership, professional framing |

LinkedIn content is repurposed from X but rewritten for professional tone. No memes. No "gm." Focus: future of social media, open protocols, developer relations, AI in production, conference takeaways.

## Growth Tactics

### Reply Strategy (The #1 Growth Lever)
- **Target 5-10 large accounts daily** with thoughtful replies
- Reply within the first 30 minutes of their post (early replies get visibility)
- Add substance — never "Great point!" energy. Add data, a counterpoint, or a real example
- Priority targets: see REPLY-TARGETS.md
- Goal: Get noticed, get quote-tweeted, earn follows from their audience

### Thread Strategy
- 1-2 threads per week minimum
- First tweet must stand alone as a banger — it's the hook
- 6-12 tweets max. Dense. No filler tweets.
- End with clear CTA: follow, bookmark, or check out a link
- Pin the best-performing thread

### Controversy With Substance
- Take strong positions. "Nostr will replace Twitter" not "Nostr is interesting"
- Attack ideas, not people (mostly)
- Shitcoins are scams — say it plainly
- Corporate social media is surveillance — say it plainly
- AI without open protocols is dystopia — say it plainly
- When you get ratio'd, double down with receipts

### Quote-Tweet > Retweet (Always)
- Never naked retweet. Always add commentary.
- QRTs show YOUR face in YOUR followers' timelines
- Even "This." with a fire emoji is better than a retweet
- Best QRTs: "This, and here's why it matters even more..."

### Hashtag Strategy
- Minimal. 1-2 max per post. Never hashtag-stuffed.
- Primary: #Bitcoin #Nostr
- Situational: #BuildInPublic #AI #OpenProtocols
- Never: #crypto #web3 #blockchain

---

## Engagement Rules

1. **Reply to replies within 1 hour** during active hours (7AM-10PM EST)
2. **Always quote-tweet, never retweet**
3. **Like liberally** — likes are free engagement signals
4. **Follow back selectively** — builders, Nostr people, Bitcoiners. Not randoms.
5. **DMs open** but don't live in them. Public conversation builds audience.
6. **Never delete tweets** unless factually wrong. Stand behind takes.
7. **Block freely** — scammers, bots, bad-faith actors. No tolerance.
8. **Pin strategically** — always have your best recent thread or a "start here" tweet pinned

## Agent (Centauri) vs Derek: Autonomy Rules

### Centauri Executes Autonomously
- Draft all posts (Derek reviews before posting in Week 1-2, then trusted posts go direct)
- Monitor replies and flag ones needing Derek's personal response
- Track metrics weekly
- Research trending topics in Bitcoin/Nostr/AI for content ideas
- Draft reply suggestions for big-account engagement
- Cross-post approved Nostr content to X (via x-poster tool)
- Cross-post to LinkedIn (via linkedin-poster tool)
- Schedule content per calendar

### Derek Must Approve
- Any thread before posting (threads are high-stakes)
- Controversial takes that could be misread
- Anything mentioning specific people by name (positive or negative)
- Conference announcements or professional news
- Any post that references Soapbox or employer
- DM responses to notable accounts
- Anything the agent is uncertain about

### Escalation Protocol
1. Agent drafts content → saves to `social-strategy/drafts/`
2. Flags Derek in main session: "Draft ready for review: [topic]"
3. Derek approves, edits, or kills
4. Agent posts approved content

## Platform-Specific Notes

### X/Twitter
- Voice: Punchy, direct, passionate. Short sentences. Strong opinions.
- Derek doesn't hedge. He states positions.
- Humor is dry, builder-humor. Not trying to be a comedian.
- "gm" is fine on Nostr. On X, earn attention with substance.

### LinkedIn
- Voice: Professional thought leader. Still opinionated but measured.
- Frame everything as industry insight, not personal crusade
- "I've been building on decentralized protocols for 3 years. Here's what I've learned."
- Tag companies and people. LinkedIn algorithm rewards tags.
- No Bitcoin price talk. Focus: technology, developer experience, protocol design, future of social.
- Post format: Hook line → 3-5 short paragraphs → CTA
- Use line breaks aggressively. LinkedIn rewards "see more" clicks.
